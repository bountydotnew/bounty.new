## Bounty Submission Quickstart

Use this flow when a GitHub issue includes bounty instructions (example: issue #188).

1. Fork and create a branch from `main`
2. Implement the smallest verifiable change for the issue
3. Open a PR that references the issue URL
4. In PR description, add `@bountydotnew submit`
5. If needed, comment `/submit #PR_NUMBER` on the issue
6. Wait for maintainer review and approval

## Minimal Evidence Checklist

- Include the issue link in your PR description
- Include one short test or verification note
- Keep the scope small and directly tied to the issue

## Why this file exists

Issue #188 is a test bounty. This guide gives contributors a repeatable submit/claim path so first submissions do not get stuck on process.
