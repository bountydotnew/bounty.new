AI Smell Rubric

Overview

Use this checklist to actively evaluate and edit each doc or blog post for “AI-smell.” For every section below, scan the text, check the boxes that apply, and rewrite any part that triggers multiple “AI-ish” items. Aim to reduce generic patterns and increase specific, idiosyncratic voice before publishing.

A. Style & Structure

When reviewing, ask: “Does this read like a template or like me?”

Structure is not a generic “intro → list → recap → CTA” template; sections vary in length and rhythm.

Headings are specific and content-rich (avoid bare “Introduction”, “Conclusion”, “Key Takeaways” unless there’s a strong reason).

First sentence of each section adds new information instead of just rephrasing the heading.

Lists vary in length and syntax; not every bullet starts with identical patterns (“First,” “Next,” “Finally,” etc.)

Adjacent paragraphs each introduce a distinct idea rather than rewording the same point.

B. Punctuation & Formatting

When reviewing, scan for mechanically repeated punctuation habits.

Em dashes are used intentionally and sparingly, not as the default connector in most sentences

Ellipses (“...”) are rare and only used when a genuine trailing-off or omission is needed.

Punctuation style shows some natural variation (not robotically uniform in every sentence).

There are a few harmless quirks or non-critical inconsistencies, so the text doesn’t feel perfectly machine-clean

C. Lexicon & Phrasing

When reviewing, replace generic language with concrete, contextual wording.

Concrete, domain-specific words outweigh generic buzzwords (“leverage”, “unlock value”, “optimize”, “navigate change”).

Overused shells are minimized or rewritten (e.g., “In today’s fast-paced world…”, “At its core,” “The bottom line is…”).

Formulaic contrasts like “It’s not just about X — it’s about Y” are used rarely and only when genuinely needed.

The same idea is not padded out by multiple near-duplicate sentences; redundant paraphrases are removed.

D. Semantics & Content

When reviewing, check that each section actually says something specific.

Important claims are backed by concrete examples, stories, data, or named references where appropriate.

Vague hyperbole (“revolutionary”, “game-changing”, “incredible”) is either cut or grounded in specific evidence.

Each section contributes new information or perspective instead of restating earlier content.

Abstract nouns (“innovation”, “transformation”, “impact”) are balanced with clear, observable details and actions.

E. Voice & Idiosyncrasy

When reviewing, deliberately inject your voice where it feels flat.

Personal voice is visible through opinions, preferences, or small quirks that clearly sound like you.

First person or a clear stance is used when appropriate, instead of always-neutral, “corporate” tone.

Hedging and generic empathy phrases (“in many cases”, “might be helpful”, “it’s understandable to…”) are trimmed when they dilute clarity.

The piece includes occasional unconventional metaphors, examples, or asides that a generic assistant would be unlikely to generate.
